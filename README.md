# GoWebServer
Creating a small web server with Golang :)


just a go install on your system and vs also cheers :)



we're building a server file and there will be just three routes.
first one is the root route which is just a slash that when we hit it opens up the index.html file
second one is the slash hello, which will call the hello function as of now will just print hello :)
third will be the slash form which will have a form function associated with it and then that will open up a form.html file
